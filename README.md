Task.txt contain specific instruction to solve Lab
The second and third document are lab solution and test with jest

The solution for each and every lab are solely my creative work

And all the lab pass the tests with the exception of SocksLaunderingSolution.js which pass 10/12. (I shall update in due time).

I carried out the 8 Lab works with 3 days owing to the fact that some require more programming will and time(Example of such is BinarySearchOccurrenceSolution.js and SocksLaunderingSolution.js).
